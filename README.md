# Popular Movies - stage 1

## Goal

Build a simple movies app that communicates with the internet and provides a responsive user experience. In this project, youâ€™ll fetch data from the Internet with the MovieDB API, use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views, and incorporate libraries to simplify your code.

## Libraries

- Butterknife
- Picasso
- Volley

## Note

To run the app you need an API key from themoviedb.org, more about it at the beginning of MainActivity.java.
